# Collecting and encoding the measures taken against the spread of COVID2019

## Introduction
Since February 25, 2020 Switzerland is affected by COVID-19. Modelling predictions show that this pandemic will not stop on its own and that stringent migitation strategies are needed. Switzerland has implemented a series of measures both at cantonal and federal level. The aim of this project is to collect and categorize these control measures implemented and provide an updated data set, which can be used for modelling or visualization purposes.

This project is a collaborative effort by volunteers (see contributors below). The repository is open to contribution, contact Simone Baffelli (https://twitter.com/bafe) or Fabienne Krauer (https://twitter.com/FabiKrauer).  

## Methods
We collect all available information about measures taken in response to COVID-19 from official cantonal and federal press releases (raw data). We then categorize all measures as far as possible (see below). All categorizations are reviewed by a second person. Information is updated once a week. The raw data are collected in Google spreadsheets. When updated the raw data are merged, cleaned and reduced to dummy variables to make them more useful for research with an R script. 


### Data format
We collected the following information:

- collection of data on the number of confirmed cases and on the number of performed tests, patients with severe disease progression and number of recovered patients.  This is part of another [challenge](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/73) of this hackathon. This data can be considered the *dependent variable* and can be used directly (with the usual caveats regarding specificity, sensitivity, sampling bias etc.) to measure the effect of the measures.
- collection of data on [mobility](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/66), [air quality](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/63), mobile phone location data (eg https://github.com/statistikZH/monitoring_covid19/blob/master/Mobility_GooglePopularTimeGraph.md) and data on [consumer behavior](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/62). This information doesn't directly correlate with case data, however it can be used to infer the adhesion of the general population to the imposed measures regardless of their disease status.
